= DESCRIPTION:

Installs Jenkins.

= REQUIREMENTS:

== Platform:

Tested on Ubuntu 10.04, should work on other platforms.

== Cookbooks:

Opscode cookbooks, http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master:

* nginx

= ATTRIBUTES: 

* jenkins[:port] - local port for Jenkins server to listen on.  Default 8080.

= USAGE:

We provide an nginx configuration that will proxy for the Jenkins
server; it's generally a bad idea to expose it directly to the
Internet.
